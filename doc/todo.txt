- very simple map data structure
	top left = 0,0
	direction= 0:R, 1:RT, 2:TR, 3:T, 4:TL, 5:LT, 6:L, 7:LB, 8:BL, 9:B, 10:BR, 11:RB = each 30 degrees
	very simple building map.. 1 room
	base wall material that doesn't morph in any way.. only 1 material
	second wall material that will become straight
		line matcher notation: only this matches
			2 -> direction or -1 = indirect wobble.. allow plus/min 1
			0 -> direction or -1 = wobble
		Corners .. not yet
			B & RT & TL
			B & LT & TR
			U & LB & BR
			U & RB & BL
		6 directions of 2 steps line.. LT T RT LB B TB identical to walls from center of tiles 
		indirect wobble line: direction out != direction in .. but 1 off
			also move points to centre
			up/down half the wobble diameter
		direct wobble line: direction out = direction in
			into straight by moving points to line
			left/right half the wobble diameter
		draw this
- draw single map on canvas.. inside = gray, outside = open
	for now draw each tile separately
- show different colors for floor materials
- add walls as thicker colored lines and doors / windows
	separate pass
- indicators of player/NPC/item positions
- very simple editor.. show current position/rotation.. allow to change current material/walls in directions
- multiple levels and stairs.. including roofs.. do not show levels above the player
- show as web-GL object
- semi-transparent levels above the player
- general lighting .. spot lights
- optional view from player... do not draw distance
- draw distance with calculated height map
- long distance with less accurate height map
- near distance with displacement map
