jetty integration
- initial page load
    jquery-ui "Dark Hive" - resizable / tabs / selectable
    pane with walls / floors / items / height tools  / elements
- undo buffer.. last action / last continues simple edits
	elder content around a position
- rotate world .. needed for easy drag/drop
- drag select tiles to named elements / multiple layers
	rename, copy, remove, add layers
	tooltip with details.. ref of html page with details
- select named element and edit details
- save map and defined elements
    flip/rotate element.. possibly 15% rotate

- more types of 90Â° angles to walls.. no crosses yet
	two types of angles.. 
- walls with specified thickness
	inner points are not the same position as outer points
		loop through the 6 walls instead of the 3 upper walls per tile
			add color numbers to to the defined materials
			use this loop to fill the tile with the correct color
		when the wall size = 0 stop with this routine
		detect if one side of the wall is filled... stop with this routine
			determine the resulting wall angles at the end points
			move this point with the thickness relative to the 2 wall angles towards the tile
- inside walls between rooms with possible crosses and connection to outer walls
- doors / window indications
	indicator of what is inside and what is outside the rooms
	each type of door/window will have an indicator if they open outwards or inwards
	inner room doors normally open towards outer doors (halls)
- 15% walls: 8 sided towers
- trapezoid bay window
- first simple rounded tower / stairs
- separate map with cached move of points: this is for efficiency to prevent several times recalculation
	2 values per tile .. Left/Right both top.. for now 8 bytes.. more bit packing is not yet implemented
	L/R direction of movement (0-47) possibly 94  .. 6 bits
	L/R distance of movement in points (0-50)..      6 bits
	L/R direction of normal (0-47) possibly 94..     6 bits		for round structures
	height difference of point relative to center	 1 byte
- indicators of player/NPC/item positions
- very simple editor.. show current position/rotation.. allow to change current material/walls in directions
- multiple levels and stairs.. including roofs.. do not show levels above the player
- show as web-GL object
- semi-transparent levels above the player
- general lighting .. spot lights
- optional view from player... do not draw distance
- draw distance with calculated height map
- long distance with less accurate height map
- near distance with displacement map
