- very simple map data structure:
	On a cross move halfway towards the dead end when it exists .. do no draw the dead end itself
	Show the patterns of the now inconsistent lower block corners.. can we find a pattern to recognize? 
	Base wall material that doesn't morph in any way.. only 1 material
- draw single map on canvas.. inside = gray, outside = open
	for now draw each tile separately
- show different colors for floor materials
- add walls as thicker colored lines and doors / windows
	separate pass
- indicators of player/NPC/item positions
- very simple editor.. show current position/rotation.. allow to change current material/walls in directions
- multiple levels and stairs.. including roofs.. do not show levels above the player
- show as web-GL object
- semi-transparent levels above the player
- general lighting .. spot lights
- optional view from player... do not draw distance
- draw distance with calculated height map
- long distance with less accurate height map
- near distance with displacement map
