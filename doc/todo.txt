- more types of 90Â° angles to walls.. no crosses yet
- walls with specified thickness
	inner points are not the same position as outer points
		loop through the 6 walls instead of the 3 upper walls per tile
			add color numbers to to the defined materials
			use this loop to fill the tile with the correct color
		when the wall size = 0 stop with this routine
		detect if one side of the wall is filled... stop with this routine
			determine the resulting wall angles at the end points
			move this point with the thickness relative to the 2 wall angles towards the tile
- inside walls between rooms with possible crosses and connection to outer walls
- doors / window indications
	indicator of what is inside and what is outside the rooms

- multiple levels and stairs.. including roofs.. do not show levels above the player
- show as web-GL object
- semi-transparent levels above the player
- general lighting .. spot lights
- optional view from player... do not draw distance
- draw distance with calculated height map
