Straight lines that are drawn will not follow the sides of tiles exactly but round them off.
This result is slightly different for the two types of aproximation in use.

Line that cuts though sides of the tiles results in evenly spaced dots each 45 points.
The other line that cuts the points of tiles results in slightly larger spaces of 52 points.
